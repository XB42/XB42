# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi! I'm Bux Khurana. I first heard about Bitcoin back in 2014. At that time, I dismissed it as a currency used by **criminals**. 6 years later, I couldn't be more passionate about any other industry. I have created products and protocols on a large number of EVM-compatible chains and will definitely continue to do so. With my strong tech background, I approach every product engineering-first and have a keen eye for security vulnerabilities.
